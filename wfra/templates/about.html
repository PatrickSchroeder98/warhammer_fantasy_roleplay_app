    <h3>Please note that all information in the form is required. If some fields are not relevant,
    an acceptable answer should be 'None', '-' or '0' in the case of numerical values. If a character does not have any
    advanced skills, these fields should be filled with placeholders.</h3>

    <h3>Character details can be accessed from the main list of user characters. In the detail view, users have
    the option to update or delete a character.</h3>
